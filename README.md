# fvttdev
WARNING: Pre-alpha release.

Provides a zero config build & bundle CLI tool for Foundry VTT based on Rollup and Oclif.

So far only the `bundle` command is implemented and provides zero config for JS and Typescript development. 
CSS / Sass / Less / Stylus setup with PostCSS and more.

Seriously super pre-alpha release. The bundle command works well, but docs, tutorials, and more information and final 
polish plus other commands are forthcoming soon. 

Please refer to the demo repo:

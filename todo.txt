1. Flag verification; especially
  - shorthand 'char' overlap
  - flag parsing for matched "<XXX>=<XXX>"

2. Examine esmbundler and entry points / initial code handling for JS / TS

3. TODO: consider `cwd` flag and implications

4. Parse module.json / system.json



Before publishing
---------

Make and test a separate modules for FlagHandler & RollupRunner

---------

Keep in mind:
- Our CLI error handler is potentially a big fragile (needs better testing for node org / non-org modules).

- It appears that @oclif/plugin-not-found does not appear to play nice w/ dynamic command flags

External projects:
typhonjs-package-util - `formatFromError` does not take into account NPM organizations.

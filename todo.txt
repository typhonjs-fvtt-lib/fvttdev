3. Integrate babel
   - Determine if the code to bundle is JS; set a configuration flag to kick off babel.

4. Integrate Typescript

5. Respect any local configuration files provided.
   - Have a flag / env override to ignore local config files

RollupRunner / Bundle Events
// Allow plugins a chance to parse any config data when
triggerAsync    'typhonjs:oclif:bundle:data:parse' -> packageData, bundleData

// Triggered during the rollup / bundle process allowing Oclif plugins to return specific Rollup plugins.
triggerAsync    'typhonjs:oclif:bundle:plugins:main:output:get' -> bundleData
triggerAsync    'typhonjs:oclif:bundle:plugins:npm:input:get' -> bundleData

?. Add multiple bundle events
   - add more event callbacks for plugins to respond to

Testing phase
---------
// TODO MUST CHECK CWD and directory path ramifications
  - CWD when loading esmodules entry point and local relative paths.
    - esmodules entry point is considered to be in the same directory as module / system.json.

- Consider looking if a verification method needs to be added to plugin-string for bad user data.
  Test w/ underlying Rollup plugin

- In bundle command there are multiple array includes usages, so consider structuring data differently for performance.

Before publishing
---------

- Make and test a separate modules for FlagHandler & RollupRunner

---------

Keep in mind:
- Our CLI error handler is potentially a big fragile (needs better testing for node org / non-org modules).

- It appears that @oclif/plugin-not-found does not appear to play nice w/ dynamic command flags

---------

External projects:
backbone-esnext-events - triggerSync & triggerAsync will insert `null` for callbacks that match, but don't return a value.
typhonjs-package-util - `formatFromError` does not take into account NPM organizations.
